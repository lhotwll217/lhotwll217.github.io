With dynamic black-and-white images that document carless streets and children engaged in inventive and self-directed forms of play, the 1968 images speak to present-day questions of whom and what purposes city streets might serve.<\/p>\n\n<p>Katrina Thomas (1927-2018) was hired to document Mayor Lindsay&rsquo;s 1968 Task Force initiatives and later donated those photographs to NYC Parks. Her images were commissioned to use for publicity, fundraising appeals, and official reports, and intended to offer visual proof that the city was compensating for a lack of investment in low-income, racially segregated neighborhoods. But Thomas&rsquo; exceptional eye transcended the task. Her photographs represent one of the most complicated yet revealing collections of imagery in the Photo Archives&mdash;shaped by the tension between the demands of a commissioned project and Thomas&rsquo; personal perspective.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Curated by Rebekah Burgess, NYC Parks Photo Archivist, and Mariana Mogilevich, historian of architecture and urbanism and Editor in Chief, Urban Omnibus.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note: <\/strong>Mask-wearing is required to enter the Arsenal Gallery, and guests are required to sign in.

With dynamic black-and-white images that document carless streets and children engaged in inventive and self-directed forms of play, the 1968 images speak to present-day questions of whom and what purposes city streets might serve.<\/p>\n\n<p>Katrina Thomas (1927-2018) was hired to document Mayor Lindsay&rsquo;s 1968 Task Force initiatives and later donated those photographs to NYC Parks. Her images were commissioned to use for publicity, fundraising appeals, and official reports, and intended to offer visual proof that the city was compensating for a lack of investment in low-income, racially segregated neighborhoods. But Thomas&rsquo; exceptional eye transcended the task. Her photographs represent one of the most complicated yet revealing collections of imagery in the Photo Archives&mdash;shaped by the tension between the demands of a commissioned project and Thomas&rsquo; personal perspective.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Curated by Rebekah Burgess, NYC Parks Photo Archivist, and Mariana Mogilevich, historian of architecture and urbanism and Editor in Chief, Urban Omnibus.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note: <\/strong>Mask-wearing is required to enter the Arsenal Gallery, and guests are required to sign in.

With dynamic black-and-white images that document carless streets and children engaged in inventive and self-directed forms of play, the 1968 images speak to present-day questions of whom and what purposes city streets might serve.<\/p>\n\n<p>Katrina Thomas (1927-2018) was hired to document Mayor Lindsay&rsquo;s 1968 Task Force initiatives and later donated those photographs to NYC Parks. Her images were commissioned to use for publicity, fundraising appeals, and official reports, and intended to offer visual proof that the city was compensating for a lack of investment in low-income, racially segregated neighborhoods. But Thomas&rsquo; exceptional eye transcended the task. Her photographs represent one of the most complicated yet revealing collections of imagery in the Photo Archives&mdash;shaped by the tension between the demands of a commissioned project and Thomas&rsquo; personal perspective.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Curated by Rebekah Burgess, NYC Parks Photo Archivist, and Mariana Mogilevich, historian of architecture and urbanism and Editor in Chief, Urban Omnibus.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note: <\/strong>Mask-wearing is required to enter the Arsenal Gallery, and guests are required to sign in.

What is seeing? Reflecting on Lewis Latimer&rsquo;s invention of the carbon filament, the word filament comes from the root &ldquo;Gwhi,&rdquo; which means a thread or to string together. We will begin this lab series looking at the practice of making connections to conceptualize and reflect on what KwaNTum can be as a creative ground to develop ideas.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>8\/10 - Synthesizing Echoes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to hear? How does sound and voice become more than noise but technologies for meaning and communication? Looking at excerpts from selected texts about and listening to various Black-originating music styles like Jazz, Hip-Hop, Dub, Blues, etc., we will explore them as technologies of knowledge-sharing and as forms of science. Through this session, we will generate poetic texts that act as scores to innovate new languages.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>9\/14 - Recipes for Knowledge: External Exchangeware<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Respiration. Reinspiration. The Mouth. The Myth. The Nose. The Knows. What flows in and out of our bodies helps to shape who we are. We will look at how exchange and communication manifest in various forms of sense. Referring to scholar, Sylvia Wynter&rsquo;s, concept of humans as both &ldquo;bio and mythoi,&rdquo; or &ldquo;homo narrans,&rdquo; we will explore themes of the body as a receiver and interpreter of signals, in constant conversation with &ldquo;alien\" intelligences, and how this relates to practices like call and response in Black cultures.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>10\/12 - Architexture: Touch and Text<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>What if we rethink of common sense as &ldquo;community sense?&rdquo; How does relationship and sense of relationship affect how we know? How do embodied networks of the self operate? What does skin reveal about knowledge? Inspired by Octavia Butler&rsquo;s practice of &ldquo;primitive hypertext,&rdquo; we will explore how relationships of touch create knowledge systems and structures.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>11\/9 - Polysensic Semantics<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Language can be considered a form of synesthesia. How does language become a multidimensional container for the interweaving of all senses? What is the meaning of knowledge when it is applied and experienced within a body? We will use somatic work to explore the shapeshifting of language to show how meaning changes in each person&rsquo;s body.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>12\/14 - KwaNTum Presence Performance: Interactive Performance<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In this final performance, I invite participants to be a part of a communal, interactive, semi-improvised performance where our texts are weaved into one another into a larger, collaborative text.

With dynamic black-and-white images that document carless streets and children engaged in inventive and self-directed forms of play, the 1968 images speak to present-day questions of whom and what purposes city streets might serve.<\/p>\n\n<p>Katrina Thomas (1927-2018) was hired to document Mayor Lindsay&rsquo;s 1968 Task Force initiatives and later donated those photographs to NYC Parks. Her images were commissioned to use for publicity, fundraising appeals, and official reports, and intended to offer visual proof that the city was compensating for a lack of investment in low-income, racially segregated neighborhoods. But Thomas&rsquo; exceptional eye transcended the task. Her photographs represent one of the most complicated yet revealing collections of imagery in the Photo Archives&mdash;shaped by the tension between the demands of a commissioned project and Thomas&rsquo; personal perspective.  <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note: <\/strong>RSVP is required for this event.

With dynamic black-and-white images that document carless streets and children engaged in inventive and self-directed forms of play, the 1968 images speak to present-day questions of whom and what purposes city streets might serve.<\/p>\n\n<p>Katrina Thomas (1927-2018) was hired to document Mayor Lindsay&rsquo;s 1968 Task Force initiatives and later donated those photographs to NYC Parks. Her images were commissioned to use for publicity, fundraising appeals, and official reports, and intended to offer visual proof that the city was compensating for a lack of investment in low-income, racially segregated neighborhoods. But Thomas&rsquo; exceptional eye transcended the task. Her photographs represent one of the most complicated yet revealing collections of imagery in the Photo Archives&mdash;shaped by the tension between the demands of a commissioned project and Thomas&rsquo; personal perspective.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Curated by Rebekah Burgess, NYC Parks Photo Archivist, and Mariana Mogilevich, historian of architecture and urbanism and Editor in Chief, Urban Omnibus.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note: <\/strong>Mask-wearing is required to enter the Arsenal Gallery, and guests are required to sign in.

We also work to deepen an appreciation of comedy as a cultural asset and seek to include comedy as a creative alternative to tackling societal issues.  The way that we do both is by producing free comedy shows in public spaces. We think unexpected laughter in unexpected places can send a powerful message to the psyche and be a catalyst for unity. The organization is volunteer-run by proud native New Yorkers to bring leading comedic artists to New Yorkers for free to deepen an appreciation of the art form and make live performances available regardless of age, sobriety or social strata. Each show draws a diverse group of New Yorkers together through humor on stage and off. It is run solely by volunteers.  For more info, visit our website at www.nylaughs.org. We want to make laughter a part of the daily urban experience and turn NYC strangers into neighbors. Comedy matters.

With dynamic black-and-white images that document carless streets and children engaged in inventive and self-directed forms of play, the 1968 images speak to present-day questions of whom and what purposes city streets might serve.<\/p>\n\n<p>Katrina Thomas (1927-2018) was hired to document Mayor Lindsay&rsquo;s 1968 Task Force initiatives and later donated those photographs to NYC Parks. Her images were commissioned to use for publicity, fundraising appeals, and official reports, and intended to offer visual proof that the city was compensating for a lack of investment in low-income, racially segregated neighborhoods. But Thomas&rsquo; exceptional eye transcended the task. Her photographs represent one of the most complicated yet revealing collections of imagery in the Photo Archives&mdash;shaped by the tension between the demands of a commissioned project and Thomas&rsquo; personal perspective.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Curated by Rebekah Burgess, NYC Parks Photo Archivist, and Mariana Mogilevich, historian of architecture and urbanism and Editor in Chief, Urban Omnibus.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note: <\/strong>Mask-wearing is required to enter the Arsenal Gallery, and guests are required to sign in.

With dynamic black-and-white images that document carless streets and children engaged in inventive and self-directed forms of play, the 1968 images speak to present-day questions of whom and what purposes city streets might serve.<\/p>\n\n<p>Katrina Thomas (1927-2018) was hired to document Mayor Lindsay&rsquo;s 1968 Task Force initiatives and later donated those photographs to NYC Parks. Her images were commissioned to use for publicity, fundraising appeals, and official reports, and intended to offer visual proof that the city was compensating for a lack of investment in low-income, racially segregated neighborhoods. But Thomas&rsquo; exceptional eye transcended the task. Her photographs represent one of the most complicated yet revealing collections of imagery in the Photo Archives&mdash;shaped by the tension between the demands of a commissioned project and Thomas&rsquo; personal perspective.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Curated by Rebekah Burgess, NYC Parks Photo Archivist, and Mariana Mogilevich, historian of architecture and urbanism and Editor in Chief, Urban Omnibus.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note: <\/strong>Mask-wearing is required to enter the Arsenal Gallery, and guests are required to sign in.

With dynamic black-and-white images that document carless streets and children engaged in inventive and self-directed forms of play, the 1968 images speak to present-day questions of whom and what purposes city streets might serve.<\/p>\n\n<p>Katrina Thomas (1927-2018) was hired to document Mayor Lindsay&rsquo;s 1968 Task Force initiatives and later donated those photographs to NYC Parks. Her images were commissioned to use for publicity, fundraising appeals, and official reports, and intended to offer visual proof that the city was compensating for a lack of investment in low-income, racially segregated neighborhoods. But Thomas&rsquo; exceptional eye transcended the task. Her photographs represent one of the most complicated yet revealing collections of imagery in the Photo Archives&mdash;shaped by the tension between the demands of a commissioned project and Thomas&rsquo; personal perspective.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Curated by Rebekah Burgess, NYC Parks Photo Archivist, and Mariana Mogilevich, historian of architecture and urbanism and Editor in Chief, Urban Omnibus.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note: <\/strong>Mask-wearing is required to enter the Arsenal Gallery, and guests are required to sign in.

With dynamic black-and-white images that document carless streets and children engaged in inventive and self-directed forms of play, the 1968 images speak to present-day questions of whom and what purposes city streets might serve.<\/p>\n\n<p>Katrina Thomas (1927-2018) was hired to document Mayor Lindsay&rsquo;s 1968 Task Force initiatives and later donated those photographs to NYC Parks. Her images were commissioned to use for publicity, fundraising appeals, and official reports, and intended to offer visual proof that the city was compensating for a lack of investment in low-income, racially segregated neighborhoods. But Thomas&rsquo; exceptional eye transcended the task. Her photographs represent one of the most complicated yet revealing collections of imagery in the Photo Archives&mdash;shaped by the tension between the demands of a commissioned project and Thomas&rsquo; personal perspective.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Curated by Rebekah Burgess, NYC Parks Photo Archivist, and Mariana Mogilevich, historian of architecture and urbanism and Editor in Chief, Urban Omnibus.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note: <\/strong>Mask-wearing is required to enter the Arsenal Gallery, and guests are required to sign in.

With dynamic black-and-white images that document carless streets and children engaged in inventive and self-directed forms of play, the 1968 images speak to present-day questions of whom and what purposes city streets might serve.<\/p>\n\n<p>Katrina Thomas (1927-2018) was hired to document Mayor Lindsay&rsquo;s 1968 Task Force initiatives and later donated those photographs to NYC Parks. Her images were commissioned to use for publicity, fundraising appeals, and official reports, and intended to offer visual proof that the city was compensating for a lack of investment in low-income, racially segregated neighborhoods. But Thomas&rsquo; exceptional eye transcended the task. Her photographs represent one of the most complicated yet revealing collections of imagery in the Photo Archives&mdash;shaped by the tension between the demands of a commissioned project and Thomas&rsquo; personal perspective.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Curated by Rebekah Burgess, NYC Parks Photo Archivist, and Mariana Mogilevich, historian of architecture and urbanism and Editor in Chief, Urban Omnibus.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note: <\/strong>Mask-wearing is required to enter the Arsenal Gallery, and guests are required to sign in.

Set against the backdrop of the woods and wetlands surrounding the site, the Open Village is an immersive experience that educates and inspires. <\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 11:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 5:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 351-1611<\/p><p>Location: Historic Richmond Town<\/p>","parkids":"","parknames":"","startdate":"2022-07-21","enddate":"2022-07-21","starttime":"11:00 am","endtime":"5:00 pm","contact_phone":"(718) 351-1611","location":"Historic Richmond Town","categories":"Adaptive Programs | Education | History | Best for Kids | Tours | Walking","coordinates":"40.57006212289800000, -74.14493775367700000","image":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/common_images\/events\/628e3ec08df59.jpeg","pubDate":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 00:00:09 EDT"},{"title":"Pickleball","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/07\/21\/pickleball","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/07\/21\/pickleball","description":"<p>Date: July 21, 2022<\/p><p>Participants will complete drills and learn basic serving, return strokes, and techniques.<br\/><\/p><p>Start time: 11:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 12:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 543-8672<\/p><p>Location: Williamsbridge Oval Recreation Center (in Williamsbridge Oval)<\/p>","parkids":"X104","parknames":"Williamsbridge Oval","startdate":"2022-07-21","enddate":"2022-07-21","starttime":"11:00 am","endtime":"12:00 pm","contact_phone":"(718) 543-8672","location":"Williamsbridge Oval Recreation Center (in Williamsbridge Oval)","categories":"Sports | Seniors | Recreation Center Programming | Pickleball","coordinates":"40.87669691244100000, -73.87855219841000000","image":"","pubDate":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 00:00:09 EDT"},{"title":"Story time with Tots","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/07\/21\/story-time-with-tots","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/07\/21\/story-time-with-tots","description":"<p>Date: July 21, 2022<\/p><p>Children's stories are read to kids before they leave for the day.<\/p><p>Start time: 11:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 11:30 am<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 218-2380<\/p><p>Location: Multi-Use Room C (in McCarren Park)<\/p>","parkids":"B058","parknames":"McCarren Park","startdate":"2022-07-21","enddate":"2022-07-21","starttime":"11:00 am","endtime":"11:30 am","contact_phone":"(718) 218-2380","location":"Multi-Use Room C (in McCarren Park)","categories":"Arts & Crafts | Art | Games | Best for Kids | Theater | Talks | Recreation Center Programming","coordinates":"40.72010040000000000, -73.94999695000000000","image":"","pubDate":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 00:00:09 EDT"},{"title":"Metropolitan Pool Adult Lap Swim","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/07\/21\/metropolitan-pool-adult-lap-swim1","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/07\/21\/metropolitan-pool-adult-lap-swim1","description":"<p>Date: July 21, 2022<\/p><p>Adult Lap Swim 18+<\/p><p>Start time: 11:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 2:55 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Indoor Pool (in Metropolitan Recreation Center)<\/p>","parkids":"B085","parknames":"Metropolitan Recreation Center","startdate":"2022-07-21","enddate":"2022-07-21","starttime":"11:00 am","endtime":"2:55 pm","contact_phone":null,"location":"Indoor Pool (in Metropolitan Recreation Center)","categories":"Recreation Center Programming | Swimming\/Aquatics","coordinates":"40.71509933000000000, -73.96050262000000000","image":"","pubDate":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 00:00:09 EDT"},{"title":"Youth 5 on 5","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/07\/21\/youth-5-on-5","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/07\/21\/youth-5-on-5","description":"<p>Date: July 21, 2022<\/p><p>Participants will learn basic ball handling, defense, dribbling, passing, shooting, and other skills and techniques.<\/p><p>Start time: 11:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 12:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 293-5934<\/p><p>Location: Gymnasium (Part B) (in Kwame Ture Recreation Center)<\/p>","parkids":"X261","parknames":"Kwame Ture Recreation Center","startdate":"2022-07-21","enddate":"2022-07-21","starttime":"11:00 am","endtime":"12:30 pm","contact_phone":"(718) 293-5934","location":"Gymnasium (Part B) (in Kwame Ture Recreation Center)","categories":"Sports | Recreation Center Programming | Basketball\/Netball","coordinates":"40.84400970000000000, -73.91892904000000000","image":"","pubDate":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 00:00:09 EDT"},{"title":"Intro to Web Design w\/Wix.com","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/07\/21\/intro-to-web-design-wwixcom","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/07\/21\/intro-to-web-design-wwixcom","description":"<p>Date: July 21, 2022<\/p><p>Create a free website with Wix.com.

Adapted from The Disco Project (1995), Greenberg&rsquo;s recollection of lives lost to AIDS and an acceptance of his own HIV+ status, this updated remix stages elements of its original choreography in a response to the site&rsquo;s current exhibition, Songs for a Memorial by Steven Evans.  Both works open up shared experiences of liberation, trauma, and survival through a transvisual inquiry into the power of LGBTQIA vocal anthems. We, the audience, hear instantly-recognizable earworms of RuPaul, Sylvester, and Jimmy Somerville, while witnessing post-modern dance that subverts our expectations of their embodiment. These movements are executed within Evans&rsquo; sculptural installation of classic song titles such as &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Raining Men&rdquo; and &ldquo;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real),&rdquo; rendered in glowing neon. The writer Jaime Shearn Coan cites this juxtaposition as a way in which &ldquo;camp and disco dancing provide necessary levity in the midst of tragedy.&rdquo;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nPerformances of The Disco Project Remix will take place at the New York City AIDS Memorial at Greenwich Avenue and West 12th Street on July 21 and 22 at 7:30 p.m. and on July 23 at 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. The performance is approximately 20 minutes. <\/p>\n\n<p>The event is free and open to the public.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe Disco Project Remix is curated by musician and artist Nick Hallett, as the launch of an ongoing series of unique live art events at the New York City AIDS Memorial.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: St. Vincent's Triangle<\/p>","parkids":"","parknames":"","startdate":"2022-07-21","enddate":"2022-07-21","starttime":"7:30 pm","endtime":"8:00 pm","contact_phone":null,"location":"St. Vincent's Triangle","categories":"Dance | Art | Theater | Free Summer Theater","coordinates":"40.73712983831400000, -74.00112224610200000","image":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/common_images\/events\/62b4d006d8e7e.jpg","pubDate":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 00:00:09 EDT"},{"title":"Movies Under the Stars: The Good Dinosaur","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/07\/21\/movies-under-the-stars-the-good-dinosaur","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/07\/21\/movies-under-the-stars-the-good-dinosaur","description":"<p>Date: July 21, 2022<\/p><p>Grab a blanket and come enjoy a movie in a neighborhood park or playground!

With dynamic black-and-white images that document carless streets and children engaged in inventive and self-directed forms of play, the 1968 images speak to present-day questions of whom and what purposes city streets might serve.<\/p>\n\n<p>Katrina Thomas (1927-2018) was hired to document Mayor Lindsay&rsquo;s 1968 Task Force initiatives and later donated those photographs to NYC Parks. Her images were commissioned to use for publicity, fundraising appeals, and official reports, and intended to offer visual proof that the city was compensating for a lack of investment in low-income, racially segregated neighborhoods. But Thomas&rsquo; exceptional eye transcended the task. Her photographs represent one of the most complicated yet revealing collections of imagery in the Photo Archives&mdash;shaped by the tension between the demands of a commissioned project and Thomas&rsquo; personal perspective.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Curated by Rebekah Burgess, NYC Parks Photo Archivist, and Mariana Mogilevich, historian of architecture and urbanism and Editor in Chief, Urban Omnibus.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note: <\/strong>Mask-wearing is required to enter the Arsenal Gallery, and guests are required to sign in.

Adapted from The Disco Project (1995), Greenberg&rsquo;s recollection of lives lost to AIDS and an acceptance of his own HIV+ status, this updated remix stages elements of its original choreography in a response to the site&rsquo;s current exhibition, Songs for a Memorial by Steven Evans. Both works open up shared experiences of liberation, trauma, and survival through a transvisual inquiry into the power of LGBTQIA vocal anthems. We, the audience, hear instantly-recognizable earworms of RuPaul, Sylvester, and Jimmy Somerville, while witnessing post-modern dance that subverts our expectations of their embodiment. These movements are executed within Evans&rsquo; sculptural installation of classic song titles such as &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Raining Men&rdquo; and &ldquo;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real),&rdquo; rendered in glowing neon. The writer Jaime Shearn Coan cites this juxtaposition as a way in which &ldquo;camp and disco dancing provide necessary levity in the midst of tragedy.&rdquo;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nPerformances of The Disco Project Remix will take place at the New York City AIDS Memorial at Greenwich Avenue and West 12th Street on July 21 and 22 at 7:30 p.m. and on July 23 at 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. The performance is approximately 20 minutes. <\/p>\n\n<p>The event is free and open to the public.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe Disco Project Remix is curated by musician and artist Nick Hallett, as the launch of an ongoing series of unique live art events at the New York City AIDS Memorial.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: St. Vincent's Triangle<\/p>","parkids":"","parknames":"","startdate":"2022-07-22","enddate":"2022-07-22","starttime":"7:30 pm","endtime":"8:00 pm","contact_phone":null,"location":"St. Vincent's Triangle","categories":"Dance | Art | Theater | Free Summer Theater","coordinates":"40.73712983831400000, -74.00112224610200000","image":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/common_images\/events\/62b4d0f071610.jpg","pubDate":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 00:00:09 EDT"},{"title":"Sing 2 | SummerStarz Free Movies","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/07\/22\/sing-2-summerstarz-free-movies","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/07\/22\/sing-2-summerstarz-free-movies","description":"<p>Date: July 22, 2022<\/p><p><p>SING 2: Buster Moon and his musically gifted friends must persuade the reclusive rock star Clay Calloway to join them for the opening of their new show.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/SummerStarz-2022.eventbrite.com\"><strong>RSVP on Eventbrite<\/strong><\/a><br \/>\n***<br \/>\n<br \/>\nTown Square&#39;s SummerSTARZ presents free movies on 6 wonderful Friday nights, from July 8 through August 12.

Before long, Estella&#8217;s flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute fashion legend, played by Emma Thompson (HOWARDS END, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY).

Milkweed is the only plant on which Monarch butterflies lay their eggs, which serve as the only food source for their caterpillars once they hatch. The artist will work with community members to identify milkweed, along with mugwort, a widespread plant that has been preventing the growth of milkweed in disturbed areas. Mugwort is native to Europe and Eastern Aisa and traditionally has been used as a medicinal herb.<\/p>\n\n<p>We will learn how to peel, boil and break down the bast fibers of milkweed\/mugwort stalks into pulp for casting individual sheets of paper with a screened-in framing mold. While the papers are drying, participants will be invited to share tea and write down their family histories of coming to the US as immigrants, or of being native to this land, on previously produced sheets of milkweed\/mugwort paper that they will then be shown how to fold into their origami butterfly. These origami butterflies will be put together for a future installation by Michele Brody.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Michele Brody:<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/michelebrody.com\/\">Michele Brody<\/a> completed her MFA from the Art Institute of Chicago&rsquo;s Fibers and Material Studies Department in 1994. She has maintained a full-time studio\/exhibition practice as a mixed-media community-based environmental artist in France, Germany, Costa Rica, Taiwan, Chicago, and The Bronx. Recent one-person shows include the Bronx Museum and artist-run spaces JVS Project Space and AAA3A. In 2006 she completed two public art commissions in The Bronx for the MTA and DOE. Brody has received a grant or residency almost every year as a professional artist from the Pollock\/ Krasner Foundation, NYFA, NYSCA, Bronx Council on the Arts, Skowhegan, Headlands Center for the Arts, Ox-Bow, Sharpe-Walentas Studio Program, and most recently Wave Hill Garden and BronxArtSpace. In 2011 she was awarded Best 3-D Entry at the international Art Prize competition in Grand Rapids, Michigan for her installation &ldquo;Nature Preserve&rdquo; at the Urban Institute for Contemporary Art, and in 2017 was awarded a \" Bronx Recognizes its Own\" (BRIO) individual Artist Grant.<\/p>\n\n<p>Michele Brody has been conducting the interdisciplinary community-based project \"Reflections in Tea&rdquo; since 2007. Inspired by the worldwide tradition of drinking and sharing tea, this project has evolved over the years into many forms within a range of spaces and institutions as a mixed-media interactive installation, and as a group event called the &ldquo;CommuniTea,\" in collaboration with a wonderful array of artists and tea practitioners. The ritual performance of preparing loose-leaf tea within special paper filters is shared, after which participants&rsquo; conversations are preserved by being transcribed onto stained t-sacs that have been dried and flattened, culminating in the creation of an ever-growing series of fluttering paper quilts. From afar these quilts form an overall composition of a craggy mountain range reminiscent of the mountain sides where tea grows, while when read up close are seen to be pieced together with hundreds of individually handwritten notes and unique drawings. Initially envisioned as a mobile teahouse, the main component of \"Reflections in Tea\" is the invitation of the public to enter and sit within a semi-private space to share a pot of tea and stories.

Adapted from The Disco Project (1995), Greenberg&rsquo;s recollection of lives lost to AIDS and an acceptance of his own HIV+ status, this updated remix stages elements of its original choreography in a response to the site&rsquo;s current exhibition, Songs for a Memorial by Steven Evans. Both works open up shared experiences of liberation, trauma, and survival through a transvisual inquiry into the power of LGBTQIA vocal anthems. We, the audience, hear instantly-recognizable earworms of RuPaul, Sylvester, and Jimmy Somerville, while witnessing post-modern dance that subverts our expectations of their embodiment. These movements are executed within Evans&rsquo; sculptural installation of classic song titles such as &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Raining Men&rdquo; and &ldquo;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real),&rdquo; rendered in glowing neon. The writer Jaime Shearn Coan cites this juxtaposition as a way in which &ldquo;camp and disco dancing provide necessary levity in the midst of tragedy.&rdquo;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nPerformances of The Disco Project Remix will take place at the New York City AIDS Memorial at Greenwich Avenue and West 12th Street on July 21 and 22 at 7:30 p.m. and on July 23 at 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. The performance is approximately 20 minutes. <\/p>\n\n<p>The event is free and open to the public.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe Disco Project Remix is curated by musician and artist Nick Hallett, as the launch of an ongoing series of unique live art events at the New York City AIDS Memorial.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 5:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: St. Vincent's Triangle<\/p>","parkids":"","parknames":"","startdate":"2022-07-23","enddate":"2022-07-23","starttime":"4:00 pm","endtime":"5:30 pm","contact_phone":null,"location":"St. Vincent's Triangle","categories":"Dance | Art | Theater | Free Summer Theater","coordinates":"40.73712983831400000, -74.00112224610200000","image":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/common_images\/events\/62b4d1a2c7a76.jpg","pubDate":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 00:00:09 EDT"},{"title":"Girls Basketball","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/07\/23\/girls-basketball","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/07\/23\/girls-basketball","description":"<p>Date: July 23, 2022<\/p><p>Join us as we kick off our \"Midnight Basketball Series\"!

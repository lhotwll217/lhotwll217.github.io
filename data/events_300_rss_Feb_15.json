All participants will be walking on the track two times during the class to give your chair a rest from all your Russian twists, arm curls, leg scissors and chair running!<\/p><p>Start time: 9:30 am<\/p><p>End time: 10:30 am<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Arena (in Ocean Breeze Park)<\/p>","parkids":"R149","parknames":"Ocean Breeze Park","startdate":"2022-02-15","enddate":"2022-02-15","starttime":"9:30 am","endtime":"10:30 am","contact_phone":null,"location":"Arena (in Ocean Breeze Park)","categories":"Adaptive Programs | Fitness | Seniors | Recreation Center Programming | Exercise Classes | Strength Training\/Weightlifting | Walking","coordinates":"40.58259200000000000, -74.07530800000000000","image":"","pubDate":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 19:00:12 EST"},{"title":"Oil Painting","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/02\/15\/oil-painting","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/02\/15\/oil-painting","description":"<p>Date: February 15, 2022<\/p><p>This class has produced beautiful art pieces in this center over the years.

As such, we believe that the arts are the perfect forum to codify, message, and act upon the needs of the community &ndash; before those needs and concerns hit a tipping point.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 6:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 304-9422<\/p><p>Location: Virtual\/Online Workshop<\/p>","parkids":"","parknames":"","startdate":"2022-02-16","enddate":"2022-02-16","starttime":"6:00 pm","endtime":"7:00 pm","contact_phone":"(212) 304-9422","location":"Virtual\/Online Workshop","categories":"Art | Black History Month | Accessible Activities","coordinates":"40.71033790000000000, -74.00330290000000000","image":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/common_images\/events\/61f9528c264a5.png","pubDate":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 19:00:12 EST"},{"title":"Adult\/Senior Open Access","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/02\/16\/adultsenior-open-access","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/02\/16\/adultsenior-open-access","description":"<p>Date: February 16, 2022<\/p><p>Members 18 and older can come to our media lab and use a computer for projects, research, email, recreation, and more.<\/p><p>Start time: 6:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Media Lab (in Thomas Jefferson Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M047","parknames":"Thomas Jefferson Park","startdate":"2022-02-16","enddate":"2022-02-16","starttime":"6:00 pm","endtime":"8:00 pm","contact_phone":null,"location":"Media Lab (in Thomas Jefferson Park)","categories":"Recreation Center Programming | Media Education","coordinates":"40.79349899000000000, -73.93669891000000000","image":"","pubDate":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 19:00:12 EST"},{"title":"DIY Projects","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/02\/16\/diy-projects","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/02\/16\/diy-projects","description":"<p>Date: February 16, 2022<\/p><p>DIY Projects is a free art program that teaches children how to use simple and easy to acquire items to create something new that will last them a lifetime.

The Cold Feat course begins on the rolling fairways and takes you off into the surrounding Greenbelt trails - rustic and hilly. In trail running, you will encounter uneven terrain, exposed tree roots, and sometimes mud. The course is marked but it&#39;s necessary to pay close attention to where you&#39;re running. This is a great trail race that attracts a friendly group of runners from Staten Island and the tri-state area - it&#39;s a effective remedy for cabin fever!  <\/p>\n\n<p>Runners will receive runners swag and chipped timing bib. Due to COVID, there will be no award ceremony, but all race times will be posted online.<\/p>\n\n<p>We run in all weather conditions and, based on past race experiences, have found it can be done!  <\/p>\n\n<p>There will be no refunds offered for tickets purchased; please make sure you can make it before purchasing! <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Not running?<\/strong> <strong>Come out and volunteer with us! <\/strong> We have fun assignments and can provide community service credit for students, and we welcome families.

Join us for the first day of Part I of this year&#39;s <a href=\"https:\/\/greenthumb.nycgovparks.org\/news.html?news_id=513\">NYC Parks GreenThumb 38th Annual GreenThumb GrowTogether Conference<\/a>. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the conference will be hybrid this year, and spread out over the course of two weeks. Part I takes place virtually from Saturday, February 19 to Friday, February 25. You can register for the full conference or individual sessions, all free of cost, on <a href=\"https:\/\/gtgt22-virtual.eventbrite.com\">Eventbrite<\/a>. Part 2 will be in community gardens around the city in April 2022 (registration coming soon).<\/p>\n\n<p>The theme of this year&rsquo;s GrowTogether is &ldquo;Deeply Rooted: Growing Community Connections,&rdquo; and that is exactly what GreenThumb gardeners have been for more than four decades. Out of what were once vacant lots, GreenThumb community gardeners have cultivated green oases that feed and unify neighborhoods across New York City. GreenThumb gardeners and farmers aren&rsquo;t just growing tomatoes and tulips; they&rsquo;re also growing strong and healthy communities that put people first and recognize the vital importance of cultivating communal spaces where neighbors can come together to chart a positive future together. For over 40 years, community gardens have strengthened neighborhoods across New York City, and GreenThumb has taken great pride in supporting gardeners in that effort.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Saturday, February 19:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Opening Remarks and Keynote <\/strong><br \/>\n\t10:30 a.m. - Noon\n\t<p>Keynote Speaker: Michael W.

Join this panel to hear about community-based efforts in the pandemic with Brotherhood-Sister Sol (Manhattan), 6\/15 Green Community Garden (Brooklyn), and Bronx Community Farm Hub (Bronx). Panelists will discuss how they overcame the struggles posed by COVID and grew community connections through mutual aid, farming, and youth engagement programs. <br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\t<strong>Panelists:<br \/>\n\t- <\/strong>Gabriel Jos&eacute; Maldonado is an Environmental Facilitator at The Brotherhood-Sister Sol. Gabriel most recently worked at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden (BBG) as the Discovery Garden Assistant Program Coordinator.<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tFor well over a decade, The Brotherhood-Sister Sol has been actively engaged in the urban gardening & farming movement. They are the caretakers of the Frank White Memorial Garden and have been responsible for developing the 7,000 sq\/ft lot into an Environmental Learning Center that includes a functional Urban Farm (producing more than 20 varieties of fruits and vegetables), a Green House, a Group Challenge Course, as well as recreational seating and performing areas. All of these features have been co-designed and constructed by their youth members and local community residents. <br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\t- Che Cooper is an urban agriculturalist who works with the Bronx Community Farm Hub. He was born in Harlem, raised in the Bronx, and has worked in urban agricultural settings feeding and training communities in sustainable living. Che is currently working on becoming a certified Horticultural Therapist with the American Horticultural Therapy Association. <br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tThe Community Farm Hub system in the Bronx is a group of neighborhood gardens and farms that have long been partners with Bronx Green-Up and leaders in their neighborhoods and wider community, organizing community markets, advocating for their communities, and running youth and health programs. All are predominantly run by volunteers who wanted to come together to support increased food production and distribution in their communities.<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\t- Paul Wasserman is a retired adult education teacher\/program director and longtime food justice activist. He has been co-President of 6\/15 Green Community Garden for the past four years.

These skills and best management practices have emerged from collaborations between growers and researchers, in NYC and in cities across the world. Come discuss some trends across the U.S. in community-engaged research on soil contaminants, and the roles you can play in better protecting your community and environmental health. <br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tHannah Shayler is an Extension Associate at Cornell University, where she coordinates Healthy Soils, Healthy Communities and other programs. She works together with gardeners, farmers, community members, agency partners, researchers, educators, and others to address concerns about lead and other contaminants in soils. Through a better understanding of our soils and healthy gardening practices, we can support urban food production and the many other benefits that gardening, and farming bring to our cities and our communities.<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tPerl Egendorf learns from soils and people who work with them. Currently, she uses biogeochemical and participatory action research methods to study bacterial and fungal communities in newly constructed soils. In collaboration with many experts outside of academia, she conducts experiments on the ways urban soils can mitigate climate change, promote food justice, and support BIPOC-led movements for justice and liberation.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Best Practices for Youth Engagement <\/strong><br \/>\n\t5:30 p.m. - 7:30 p.m.<br \/>\n\tLila Elman (NYC Parks Greenthumb) and Maureen Connolly (CBK Associates)<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tThis webinar will bring together facilitators youth members to share lessons learned and best practices for meaningfully engaging youth in community gardens. Community gardeners will learn practical tips for sustaining consistent youth participation. A leadership development expert will present skill-building activities and exercises for gardeners and youth. GreenThumb will also share key findings from its recent evaluation of the YLC program, based on surveys and interviews with youth participants and adult facilitators. <br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tLila Elman is NYC Parks GreenThumb&#39;s Youth Engagement Coordinator, working to support community gardeners in facilitating Youth Leadership Councils, in partnership with NYC Service. She is a community gardener herself and has experience as a children&#39;s garden and nutrition educator.<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tMaureen Connolly of CBK Associates plans, develops and delivers content for the Youth Leadership Council program in NYC. Of special concern have been integrating service learning across the curriculum, understanding reflection, and Meeting Common Core Standards through a service-learning lens. <\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>For a complete schedule with webinar descriptions, please visit our website at <a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/GTGT2022\">bit.ly\/GTGT2022<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/greenthumb.nycgovparks.org\/news.html?news_id=521\">FAQ page<\/a> for answers to frequently asked questions.

Whether you are growing under a plastic bottle or a glasshouse, it helps to have the right materials and resources, including grants that can help cover your costs. <br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\t- Claudia Navas is a Project Manager at Farm School NYC. She has a background in community education, outreach, and program management.  She is currently contributing to Deep Routes: an Afro-Indigenous Culinary Curriculum that aims to highlight Black and Indigenous peoples&#39; foodways.<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tFarm School NYC trains local residents in urban agriculture in order to build self-reliant communities and inspire positive local action around food access and social, economic, and racial justice issues.<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\t- Zachary Tan Strein is the Garden Manager of the Wyckoff House Museum. The Wyckoff House Museum&rsquo;s builds cultural and agricultural connections within their community through innovative educational and farm-based programs. <br \/>\n\t <\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Chase Away Winter Blues by Growing Greens<\/strong><br \/>\n\t1:00 p.m. - 1:30 p.m. <br \/>\n\tVipin Bharathan (West 123 St Community Garden)<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tExplore a lightweight low tunnel setup using recycled materials over an 8&#39;x4&#39; garden bed. This design allows easy setup, removal, aeration, and cooling. The hoops can be moved easily to other beds as the seasons progress. We&#39;ll discuss choice of plants and rotation for winter harvest and speeding up seedlings for spring, summer, and fall. <br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tVipin Bharathan is a community gardener who has contributed to Liz Christy Garden, 6th Street Botanical Garden and West 123 St Community Garden. <br \/>\n\t <\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Tomato Heaven Part One: Starting from Seed <\/strong><br \/>\n\t6:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.  <br \/>\n\tMaureen O&#39;brien (Brooklyn Botanic Garden)<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tHard-to-find, heirloom, tomato varieties -- like Pole Moneymaker, Amish Paste, and Container Cherry Tomatoes -- are luscious globes of food history and chockfull of vitamins. Learn hands-on how to successfully start tomatoes from seed. <br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tMaureen O&rsquo;Brien is Brooklyn Botanic Garden Community Field Manager. She is a Master Composter, a community gardener and greening activist, and a certificate in horticulture from Brooklyn Botanic Garden.

Join us for the sixth, and final day, of Part I of this year&#39;s <a href=\"https:\/\/greenthumb.nycgovparks.org\/news.html?news_id=513\">NYC Parks GreenThumb 38th Annual GreenThumb GrowTogether Conference<\/a>. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the conference will be hybrid this year, and spread out over the course of two weeks.

You can register for the full conference or individual sessions, all free of cost, on <a href=\"https:\/\/gtgt22-virtual.eventbrite.com\">Eventbrite<\/a>.

During the winter, we might find ourselves with dry skin. In this workshop, we will learn how to work with herbs to physically and spiritually protect and connect with our bodies. We will learn how to make an herbal infused oil and salve. Through getting in touch with and resourcing our body, we connect with the earth body, plants, and others by extension. <br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tVivian Mac is a Spiritual Herbalist and the founder of Willow&#39;s Touch, which offers dream-inspired herbal remedies for being in touch with who you are, in order to heal yourself and take inspired action. She is a graduate of Sacred Vibes Spiritual Herbalism&rsquo;s Apprenticeship and her intention is to share herbal remedies that inspire inner and outer transformation, for the benefit of self, community, and the Earth and all beings that live here.  <br \/>\n\t <\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Making Herbal-Infused Honey with Community<\/strong><br \/>\n\t6:00 p.m. &ndash; 7:00 p.m. <br \/>\n\tKelly Pacumio (Sacred Vibes Apothecary)<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tHoney is a sweet liquid made by bees using nectar from flowers.  People throughout the world have hailed the benefits of honey for thousands of years. Believe it or not, honey can be even tastier by infusing it with herbs! In this workshop, we will learn about the medicinal properties of 3 herbs (Rose, Ginger, and Lavender) and how to make an herbal-infused honey. Making herbal-infused honeys are absolutely delicious and a great way to try out with kids, family, and friends, which can help us foster community connection with each other in a sweet and delicious way. <br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tKelly Pacumio is a Filipina Spiritual Herbalist and a Registered Nurse. She combines her knowledge of science and western medicine with the medicine of the earth and ancestral ways to help others towards wellness. She is also the founder of Maharlika, a herbal line that offers herbal remedies that are inspired by ancestral wisdom and healing. She is a graduate of Sacred Vibes Spiritual Herbalism&rsquo;s Apprenticeship and will forever be a student of herbalism who continues to deeply be committed to help serve communities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>For a complete schedule with webinar descriptions, please visit our website at <a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/GTGT2022\">bit.ly\/GTGT2022<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/greenthumb.nycgovparks.org\/news.html?news_id=521\">FAQ page<\/a> for answers to frequently asked questions.

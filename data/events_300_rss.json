Camp attendees will focus on urban gardening, foodways, healthy cooking, and healthy movement. This camp is for children ages 8-13. There are 45 spots available and this will be virtual to keep everyone safe. For virtual attendees, children ages 8-11 must have an adult present as they may need assistance to prepare food.<\/p>\n\n<p>Virtual attendees will need to purchase some items to participate in the cooking portion of the camp. A list will be provided after registration.

Camp attendees will focus on urban gardening, foodways, healthy cooking, and healthy movement. This camp is for children ages 8-13. There are 45 spots available and this will be virtual to keep everyone safe. For virtual attendees, children ages 8-11 must have an adult present as they may need assistance to prepare food.<\/p>\n\n<p>Virtual attendees will need to purchase some items to participate in the cooking portion of the camp. A list will be provided after registration. Additionally, each student will receive a Grow Kit to start and sustain a mini herb garden at home, an observation educational activity to continue learning after the program finishes, which they can share with their families. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flipcause.com\/secure\/cause_pdetails\/MTE4NjAy\"><strong>Register online<\/strong><\/a><\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 10:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 12:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: 212.304.9422<\/p><p>Location: Virtual\/Online Workshop<\/p>",

When sinister monsters called the Druun threaten the community, however, the dragons readily make a sacrifice to save the human race. Hundreds of years later, the same threat returns. It is up to Raya, a lone warrior, to stop them once and for all. She tracks down the last dragon alive. But as she embarks on her journey, she realizes that it will take more than a dragon and its magic to save her world.

There are 45 spots available and this will be virtual to keep everyone safe. For virtual attendees, children ages 8-11 must have an adult present as they may need assistance to prepare food.<\/p>\n\n<p>Virtual attendees will need to purchase some items to participate in the cooking portion of the camp. A list will be provided after registration. Additionally, each student will receive a Grow Kit to start and sustain a mini herb garden at home, an observation educational activity to continue learning after the program finishes, which they can share with their families. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flipcause.com\/secure\/cause_pdetails\/MTE4NjAy\"><strong>Register online<\/strong><\/a><\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 10:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 12:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: 212.304.9422<\/p><p>Location: Virtual\/Online Workshop<\/p>",

Their energy on stage and their rich sound and musical precision leave audiences mesmerized until the last note is played. With an unwavering respect for the music&rsquo;s storied history, the ensemble&rsquo;s thirteen world-class musicians and vocalists come together to create an unparalleled musical experience. SHO, as they are known to fans, is dedicated to the sounds of the barrio (Spanish Harlem, NYC). Their music is characterized by the raw, organic and vintage sound defined by the genre. They are on a mission to keep the musical legacy of salsa dura (hard salsa) alive and expand its audience to those who love great music, not just Latin music. Grounded in the past, while focused on the future, they strive to keep the music relevant, creating a unique and fresh approach. With six albums and five Grammy nominations, this powerhouse orchestra is aware that it is crucial to continually push themselves and raise the bar. Their latest release and 6th album, Anniversary, won the 2019 Grammy Award for Best Tropical Album.<\/p>\n\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/bryantpark.org\/series\/Bryant-park-picnics\">Picnic Performances<\/a> page for more information about in-park attendance.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can&#39;t make the show in-person?

Shortly after meeting at a group vocal class in Times Square, the two began getting together regularly at Erik&rsquo;s Brooklyn apartment to write music. Despite their different backgrounds (Dominican from the Bronx and Jewish from the Upper West Side) the two formed a prolific partnership. Jules and The Jinks&rsquo; work in the studio is complimented by a killer live show powered by Julissa&rsquo;s earthshaking voice and mesmerizing stage presence. Songs needing to be sung, Jules and Erik raised a band with a sound that weaves Blues, Funk, and Pop with Soul. AFROPUNK described their 2015 debut EP as \"effortlessly chill\" and declared the record&#39;s lead single, No Compromise, \"a song that deserves to be blaring from car speakers while driving through borough blocks.\" New music is currently in the works with releases throughout the 2020 year.<\/p>\n\n<p>Management reserves the right to cap participation in accordance with current COVID-19 outdoor safety guidelines.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/161978029647\">register online<\/a>. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Know Before You Go:<\/strong><br \/>\nFor everyone&#39;s safety, we are asking all participants to observe the following guidelines:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Please wear a mask if you are unvaccinated, or if it makes you feel more comfortable<\/li>\n\t<li>All individuals should maintain social distancing of six feet during programming, regardless of vaccination status<\/li>\n\t<li>Please wear a mask if social distancing cannot be maintained<\/li>\n\t<li>Wash your hands before attending a program<\/li>\n\t<li>Stay home if you are sick<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Additionally, we encourage participants to bring their own hand sanitizer to our programs.  <\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 9:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 870-3070<\/p><p>Location: Pier I (in Riverside Park South)<\/p>",

The historic settings are fully furnished for an immersive and hands-on practice. Apprentices will visit the other trades during their week to add to the fun and the 360-degree learning.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the end of each session, apprentices will have the ability to present their trade and lead a specialized tour of their workshop to visitors and their families.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2021 Apprentice Program Schedule: <\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Session 1 (July 5-9)<\/li>\n\t<li>Session 2 (July 12-16)<\/li>\n\t<li>Session 3 (July 19-23)<\/li>\n\t<li>Session 4 (July 26-30)<\/li>\n\t<li>Session 5 (Aug 2-6)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Apprentice Program is divided into two areas: <\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Junior Apprentice Program (Ages 8-11):<\/strong> Experience 19th century life with daily activities led by Historical Interpreters, including nature walks, crafts, historic games, and sample each of the Summer Apprentice Trades.

The historic settings are fully furnished for an immersive and hands-on practice. Apprentices will visit the other trades during their week to add to the fun and the 360-degree learning.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the end of each session, apprentices will have the ability to present their trade and lead a specialized tour of their workshop to visitors and their families.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2021 Apprentice Program Schedule: <\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Session 1 (July 5-9)<\/li>\n\t<li>Session 2 (July 12-16)<\/li>\n\t<li>Session 3 (July 19-23)<\/li>\n\t<li>Session 4 (July 26-30)<\/li>\n\t<li>Session 5 (Aug 2-6)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Apprentice Program is divided into two areas: <\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Junior Apprentice Program (Ages 8-11):<\/strong> Experience 19th century life with daily activities led by Historical Interpreters, including nature walks, crafts, historic games, and sample each of the Summer Apprentice Trades.

Driven by an open-minded spirit of camaraderie and exploration, they inspire listeners with vibrant programs that encompass their roots in the classical tradition and passion for artistic discovery. The orchestra has toured and recorded with renowned soloists including Yo-Yo Ma, Dawn Upshaw, B&eacute;la Fleck, and Gil Shaham, and has performed at Carnegie Hall, Tanglewood, and the Vienna Musikverein.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Knights evolved from late-night chamber music reading parties with friends at the home of violinist Colin Jacobsen and cellist Eric Jacobsen. The Jacobsen brothers, who are also founding members of the string quartet Brooklyn Rider, serve as artistic directors of The Knights, with Eric Jacobsen as conductor. The Knights are committed to creating unusual and adventurous partnerships across disciplines; they perform in traditional concert halls as well as parks, plazas, and bars, all in an effort to reach listeners of all backgrounds and invite them into their music-making. Since incorporating in 2007, the orchestra has toured consistently across the United States and Europe.<\/p>\n\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/bryantpark.org\/series\/Bryant-park-picnics\">Picnic Performances<\/a> page for more information about in-park attendance.<\/p>\n\n<p>Can&#39;t make the show in-person?

Whether sharing lead vocals and instrumental solos or blending their voices into loose, joyous harmony, the three members of Damn Tall Buildings (guitarist\/lead vocalist Max Capistran, bassist\/lead vocalist Sasha Dubyk, and fiddler\/vocalist Avery Ballotta) blend elements of bluegrass, blues, roots-rock and vintage swing to create a captivating, high-energy sound.<\/p>\n\n<p>Management reserves the right to cap participation in accordance with current COVID-19 outdoor safety guidelines.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/summer-on-the-hudson-amplified-sundays-with-damn-tall-buildings-tickets-161979189115?aff=ebdsoporgprofile\">register online<\/a><\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Know Before You Go<\/strong><br \/>\nFor everyone&#39;s safety, we are asking all participants to observe the following guidelines:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Please wear a mask if you are unvaccinated, or if it makes you feel more comfortable<\/li>\n\t<li>All individuals should maintain social distancing of six feet during programming, regardless of vaccination status<\/li>\n\t<li>Please wear a mask if social distancing cannot be maintained<\/li>\n\t<li>Wash your hands before attending a program<\/li>\n\t<li>Stay home if you are sick<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Additionally, we encourage participants to bring their own hand sanitizer to our programs.  <\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 9:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 870-3070<\/p><p>Location: Pier I (in Riverside Park South)<\/p>",

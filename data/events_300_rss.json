His Voodoo Threauxdown is returning to SummerStage this summer and is the embodiment of New Orleans&rsquo; musical melting pot, a showcase for several generations of the city&rsquo;s talent. Tank and the Bangas fuse funk, soul, hip hop, rock, and spoken word poetry, while Big Freedia is arguably the most high-profile practitioner of New Orleans bounce, a high-energy strain of hip-hop born in the city&rsquo;s housing projects. Cyril Neville and his old band the Meters loom large over the rest of the bill: While Neville is performing as &ldquo;The Uptown Ruler,&rdquo; founding bassist George Porter Jr. is performing the legendary funk band&rsquo;s music with Dumpstaphunk, which features Cyril&rsquo;s nephew Ivan Neville, whose father was the Meters&rsquo; founding keyboardist. They&rsquo;re joined by the eight-piece brass ensemble the Soul Rebels, who were given their name by Cyril after opening for him at the Uptown New Orleans venue Tipitina&rsquo;s.<\/p><\/p><p>Start

As founder of The Public Theater, Free Shakespeare in the Park and producer of groundbreaking plays like Hair, A Chorus Line and for colored girls who have considered suicide\/ when the rainbow is enuf, Papp believed great art was for everyone, not just a privileged few. A cultural change agent for more than fifty years, Papp&#8217;s stages held up a mirror to society with work that reflected the reality of people&#8217;s lives.<br\/><br\/>Papp worked to expand public access to the arts. &#8220;We have public libraries,&#8221; he would argue, &#8220;Why not public theaters?&#8221; He recognized the role artists could play in building a more democratic, inclusive society. At a time when theatre was largely the domain of white men, he was convinced that women, LGBTQIA+, BIPOC and other marginalized communities, denied power elsewhere in society, could develop it on the stage. His goal was a &#8220;theater of inclusion&#8221; on-stage, backstage, and in the audience.<br\/><br\/>Featuring rare footage from the 50s to Papp's death in 1991, and up-close scenes from the performances themselves, Joe Papp in Five Acts tells his own story without narration.

Set during the 1970s punk rock revolution in London, the story follows a clever and creative young grifter named Estella, who is determined to become a successful designer. After Estella befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, the three build a life for themselves on the London streets. Before long, Estella&#8217;s flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute fashion legend, played by Emma Thompson (HOWARDS END, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY).

Six up-and-coming bands curated by AdHoc perform on one of the biggest stages of their up-an-coming careers.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ben&eacute;t<\/strong> (Ben&eacute;t Nutall) is a singer-songwriter based in Richmond, VA. Raised in a musically inclined family, Ben&eacute;t&lsquo;s ear for melody is finely tuned. &ldquo;My mom would always say &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t sing my part&rsquo;&rdquo; Ben&eacute;t says. &ldquo;I had to come up with another line when singing together.&rdquo; Being challenged vocally, Ben&eacute;t&rsquo;s writing formed an incredible sense of harmony out of necessity. Beyond clear vocal talent, Ben&eacute;t&rsquo;s vulnerable lyrics continue to pursue the audience long after the first play. From a young age, Ben&eacute;t was drawn to creative means of expression, immersing themselves in their local scene and dipping their toes in mediums across the board. Fast forward to 21-years-old, Ben&eacute;t is acutely aware of the ways their upbringing, both in Virginia and on the Internet have impacted their music. Social media has not only informed the way they create, but who they create with. Connecting with artists online has allowed them to expand their musical bounds, and make friends along the way. Previous releases from Ben&eacute;t include &ldquo;Stan Account,&rdquo; a double single released last year with Richmond-imprint, Citrus City.<\/p>\n\n<p>Brooklyn&#39;s <strong>Dougie Poole<\/strong> puts his eccentric stamp on country music, melding eerie D.I.Y. bedroom pop textures with a love for classic honky tonk and lonesome, earthy songwriting. His self-released, home-recorded debut, Wideass Highway, earned him a contract with Wharf Cat Records, which issued his more expansive follow-up, The Freelancer&#39;s Blues, in 2020. Originally based in Providence, Rhode Island, Poole moved to Brooklyn and immersed himself in New York&#39;s indie underground, pairing his old-school country influences with synth pop and experimental music. Crooning in a low baritone over drum machines, steel guitar, and ambient synths, he established a sort of bedroom country vibe with his 2016 Olneyville System Special EP, then doubled down on the atmospheric approach for his 2017 debut, Wideass Highway. Earning plaudits for crafting modern country music for a young genre-averse urban crowd, Poole shared shows with eclectic acts like Jerry Paper, Bong Wish, and Drugdealer, guesting on the latter&#39;s 2019&#39;s album Raw Honey. After signing with New York indie Wharf Cat, he recorded his 2020 sophomore album, The Freelancer&#39;s Blues, which featured a full band and tonally leaned more toward the organic side of country music.<\/p>\n\n<p>Under her alias <strong>Daneshevskaya<\/strong>, Anna Beckerman writes tough-minded, tender-hearted songs about saying fond farewells. These aren&rsquo;t necessarily breakup anthems. Some might be addressed to a lover, but most are about friends and acquaintances, those people whose lives intersect briefly with yours before they follow their own paths elsewhere.

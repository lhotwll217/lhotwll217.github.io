Please join us for a virtual artist talk with Dario Mohr as he provides insight into his artistic vision and works, followed by a Q & A session with the audience.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Blood is Thicker than the Water that Separated U.S.\" is an exhibition of LED light works inspired by Lewis Latimer&#39;s technological triumphs, the Latimer family&#39;s history of forced migration, presented with Mohr&#39;s personal history. Mohr seeks to engage audiences in conversation around immigration, reconnection to ancestral lineage, and reclamation in one&#39;s journey of interwoven identities.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Dario Mohr<\/strong> is a New York City-based interdisciplinary artist who creates interactive sanctuary experiences. Born in 1988, Mohr received a BFA from Buffalo State College, and an MFA from The City College of New York. In addition to work created in painting, sculpture, or made digitally, he often includes assembled objects to build immersive \"sacred spaces\". These often exist in unexpected places, using mundane objects. Because objects are endowed with the significance that the viewer blesses them with, his work can provide a lot of space for divergent perspectives and interpretations. The recycling of old work is also fundamental to Mohr&#39;s practice. Sometimes a previously used item provides the perfect juxtaposition to enhance or add depth to new explorations.

This bike tour will take you to a variety of <a href=\"https:\/\/greenthumb.nycgovparks.org\/gardensearch.php\">GreenThumb community gardens<\/a> and open spaces throughout North Brooklyn, including food-producing gardens, event spaces, and botanical spaces.<\/p>\n\n<p>With a long history of advocacy around environmental justice, community leaders in Los Sures, Williamsburg, and Greenpoint have played a pivotal role in protecting and stewarding green spaces for all residents in North Brooklyn. Many community gardens were created by residents on vacant lots that were scattered across New York City, particularly in Black and Brown neighborhoods at the height of disinvestment in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, these spaces are critical to the health, well-being, and cultural life of North Brooklyn. Come hear from stewards of community gardens and see what they are growing!<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/bikenorthbrooklyngardens.eventbrite.com\">RSVP on Eventbrite<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Community gardens are volunteer-run green spaces where people can come together around growing food and community. Gardens across the city are seeking new members to plant produce and flowers, host events, maintain community spaces, and contribute extra hands for garden projects! Beginners and experienced gardeners are welcome! NYC Parks GreenThumb supports over 550 community gardens and 20,000 gardeners by providing gardening space, materials and supplies, and technical assistance at no cost. GreenThumb hosts innovative gardening workshops, trainings, and conferences.

They&rsquo;re supported by the Cribs, a British indie-rock trio connected to Modest Mouse by the famous guitarist that has played in each band&mdash;the Smiths&rsquo; Johnny Marr.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 6:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 10:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Rumsey Playfield (in Central Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M010","parknames":"Central Park","startdate":"2022-06-08","enddate":"2022-06-08","starttime":"6:00 pm","endtime":"10:00 pm","contact_phone":null,"location":"Rumsey Playfield (in Central Park)","categories":"Concerts","coordinates":"40.77279663085937500, -73.97016906738281000","image":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/common_images\/events\/628d50b44996e.jpg","pubDate":"Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:04 EDT"},{"title":"Adult Cross-training","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/06\/08\/adult-crosstraining","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/06\/08\/adult-crosstraining","description":"<p>Date: June 8, 2022<\/p><p>A more group-based high-intensity, but fun class that focuses on improving flexibility, strength and cardio -vascular capabilities that has groups of two participants moving from one station to the next in a numeral order using the \"Tabata System.\"<\/p><p>Start time: 6:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Thomas Jefferson Recreation Center (in Thomas Jefferson Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M047","parknames":"Thomas Jefferson Park","startdate":"2022-06-08","enddate":"2022-06-08","starttime":"6:30 pm","endtime":"7:30 pm","contact_phone":null,"location":"Thomas Jefferson Recreation Center (in Thomas Jefferson Park)","categories":"Adaptive Programs | Fitness | Recreation Center Programming | Exercise Classes | Strength Training\/Weightlifting","coordinates":"40.79349899291992000, -73.93669891357422000","image":"","pubDate":"Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:04 EDT"},{"title":"Summer on the Hudson: Sunset Yoga","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/06\/08\/summer-on-the-hudson-sunset-yoga","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/06\/08\/summer-on-the-hudson-sunset-yoga","description":"<p>Date: June 8, 2022<\/p><p><p>End your day with Hatha yoga in a beautiful sunset setting.<\/p>\n\n<p>Suitable for all fitness levels.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please wear loose, comfortable clothing and bring your own mat.<\/p>\n\n<p> <\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 6:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 870-3089<\/p><p>Location: The Plaza at 66th Street (in Riverside Park South)<\/p>","parkids":"M353","parknames":"Riverside Park South","startdate":"2022-06-08","enddate":"2022-06-08","starttime":"6:30 pm","endtime":"7:30 pm","contact_phone":"(212) 870-3089","location":"The Plaza at 66th Street (in Riverside Park South)","categories":"Fitness | Waterfront | Outdoor Fitness","coordinates":"40.77700042724609400, -73.99069976806640000","image":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/common_images\/events\/6244beecc6962.jpg","pubDate":"Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:04 EDT"},{"title":"Adult Lap Swim","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/06\/08\/adult-lap-swim4","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/06\/08\/adult-lap-swim4","description":"<p>Date: June 8, 2022<\/p><p>Adult Lap Swim<\/p><p>Start time: 6:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 8:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 771-2787<\/p><p>Location: Indoor Pool (in St. John's Park)<\/p>","parkids":"B245","parknames":"St. John's Park","startdate":"2022-06-08","enddate":"2022-06-08","starttime":"6:30 pm","endtime":"8:00 pm","contact_phone":"(718) 771-2787","location":"Indoor Pool (in St. John's Park)","categories":"Sports | Recreation Center Programming","coordinates":"40.67350006000000000, -73.93479919000000000","image":"","pubDate":"Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:04 EDT"},{"title":"Adult Table Tennis","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/06\/08\/adult-table-tennis","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/06\/08\/adult-table-tennis","description":"<p>Date: June 8, 2022<\/p><p>Adult and Senior Table Tennis,  ages 18 and up.

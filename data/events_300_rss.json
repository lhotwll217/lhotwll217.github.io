Ruthie Dibble, Curator of The Chipstone Foundation and Dr. Tiffany Momon, Assistant Professor at Sewanee: The University of the South.<\/p>\n\n<p>Over 150 years after the publication of <em>My Bondage and My Freedom<\/em>, Frederick Douglass&rsquo;s rhetorical genius still offers new insights into American art and history. Co-curators Drs. Ruthie Dibble and Tiffany Momon illuminate how a passage from Douglass&rsquo;s autobiography became the basis of a collaborative curatorial intervention at the Milwaukee Art Museum that explores the troubled status of luxury goods in early America. Douglass&rsquo;s words, along with those of other writers who bore witness to the injustices that shaped luxury goods in early America, offer new ways to think about the intersections of slavery, settler colonialism, and the &ldquo;profusion of luxury&rdquo; that filled many American homes in the 1800s. Prompted by Douglas&rsquo;s observation that luxury goods of enslaver households were &ldquo;Troubled, like the restless sea,&rdquo; the speakers will explore how undercurrents of power and profit shaped iconic examples of luxury goods, from the first porcelain made in America to the ornate furniture crafted in New York City for Cuban plantations. <\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/us02web.zoom.us\/webinar\/register\/WN_PlolpeoQSl6eBTWk55PFEQ\"><strong>Register online<\/strong><\/a><\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 6:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 304-9422<\/p><p>Location: Virtual\/Online Workshop<\/p>","parkids":"","parknames":"","startdate":"2021-09-22","enddate":"2021-09-22","starttime":"6:00 pm","endtime":"7:00 pm","contact_phone":"(212) 304-9422","location":"Virtual\/Online Workshop","categories":"Education | History | Talks | Virtual\/Online Events","coordinates":"40.71033790000000000, -74.00330290000000000","image":"","pubDate":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 00:00:41 EDT"},{"title":"Strength Training Open Ac","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2021\/09\/22\/strength-training-open-ac1","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2021\/09\/22\/strength-training-open-ac1","description":"<p>Date: September 22, 2021<\/p><p>Open Access Strength Training<\/p><p>Start time: 6:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 9:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (718) 972-2135<\/p><p>Location: Strength Room (in Sunset Park)<\/p>","parkids":"B087","parknames":"Sunset Park","startdate":"2021-09-22","enddate":"2021-09-22","starttime":"6:00 pm","endtime":"9:00 pm","contact_phone":"(718) 972-2135","location":"Strength Room (in Sunset Park)","categories":"Fitness | Recreation Center Programming | Strength Training\/Weightlifting","coordinates":"40.64670181000000000, -74.00239563000000000","image":"","pubDate":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 00:00:41 EDT"},{"title":"Teen Basketball (Open Access)","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2021\/09\/22\/teen-basketball-open-access","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2021\/09\/22\/teen-basketball-open-access","description":"<p>Date: September 22, 2021<\/p><p>Open Access Teen Basketball.

Each function has made the camera obscura an analog of something: the eye, human consciousness, the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; world itself (Gibson and Recoder call it &ldquo;the earliest projection of the world, or simply world projection&rdquo;). The renewed interest in the camera obscura evidenced by exhibitions like this one, and the persistence with which some filmmakers and critics work to sustain analogue moving image media, are sometimes dismissed as mere nostalgia, or contrariness for its own sake, or fetishism of technologies that have been rendered obsolete by digital. Obscurus Projectum suggests another, deeper, reason for the ongoing appeal of the analogue in the so-called digital millennium: rather than alienating us with a cryptic interior that has no &ldquo;room&rdquo; for us, camera obscuras &ndash; as models of analogue image-making technology in general &ndash; admit us, let us in. They make real space for our bodies rather than a virtual space we cannot inhabit. They are part of the physical world we live in. Analog and digital media both make images, of course, but the former also appeals to our tactile sense, and thus answers our desire for physical connection with our world and with those objects and other bodies with whom we share our rooms. (Jonathan Walley)<\/p>\n\n<p>This program is made possible by the New York City Artist Corps.<\/p>\n\n<p>Gibson + Recoder have exhibited their celebrated expanded cinema performances and installations at the Museum Kunstpalast D&uuml;sseldorf, M HKA, Serralves Foundation, EYE Film Museum, REDCAT, Mad. Sq. Art, and Ballroom Marfa. Their works are in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, and Memorial Art Gallery.

Each function has made the camera obscura an analog of something: the eye, human consciousness, the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; world itself (Gibson and Recoder call it &ldquo;the earliest projection of the world, or simply world projection&rdquo;). The renewed interest in the camera obscura evidenced by exhibitions like this one, and the persistence with which some filmmakers and critics work to sustain analogue moving image media, are sometimes dismissed as mere nostalgia, or contrariness for its own sake, or fetishism of technologies that have been rendered obsolete by digital. Obscurus Projectum suggests another, deeper, reason for the ongoing appeal of the analogue in the so-called digital millennium: rather than alienating us with a cryptic interior that has no &ldquo;room&rdquo; for us, camera obscuras &ndash; as models of analogue image-making technology in general &ndash; admit us, let us in. They make real space for our bodies rather than a virtual space we cannot inhabit. They are part of the physical world we live in. Analog and digital media both make images, of course, but the former also appeals to our tactile sense, and thus answers our desire for physical connection with our world and with those objects and other bodies with whom we share our rooms.

Each function has made the camera obscura an analog of something: the eye, human consciousness, the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; world itself (Gibson and Recoder call it &ldquo;the earliest projection of the world, or simply world projection&rdquo;). The renewed interest in the camera obscura evidenced by exhibitions like this one, and the persistence with which some filmmakers and critics work to sustain analogue moving image media, are sometimes dismissed as mere nostalgia, or contrariness for its own sake, or fetishism of technologies that have been rendered obsolete by digital. Obscurus Projectum suggests another, deeper, reason for the ongoing appeal of the analogue in the so-called digital millennium: rather than alienating us with a cryptic interior that has no &ldquo;room&rdquo; for us, camera obscuras &ndash; as models of analogue image-making technology in general &ndash; admit us, let us in. They make real space for our bodies rather than a virtual space we cannot inhabit. They are part of the physical world we live in. Analog and digital media both make images, of course, but the former also appeals to our tactile sense, and thus answers our desire for physical connection with our world and with those objects and other bodies with whom we share our rooms. (Jonathan Walley)<\/p>\n\n<p>This program is made possible by the New York City Artist Corps.<\/p>\n\n<p>Gibson + Recoder have exhibited their celebrated expanded cinema performances and installations at the Museum Kunstpalast D&uuml;sseldorf, M HKA, Serralves Foundation, EYE Film Museum, REDCAT, Mad. Sq. Art, and Ballroom Marfa. Their works are in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, and Memorial Art Gallery.

Each function has made the camera obscura an analog of something: the eye, human consciousness, the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; world itself (Gibson and Recoder call it &ldquo;the earliest projection of the world, or simply world projection&rdquo;). The renewed interest in the camera obscura evidenced by exhibitions like this one, and the persistence with which some filmmakers and critics work to sustain analogue moving image media, are sometimes dismissed as mere nostalgia, or contrariness for its own sake, or fetishism of technologies that have been rendered obsolete by digital. Obscurus Projectum suggests another, deeper, reason for the ongoing appeal of the analogue in the so-called digital millennium: rather than alienating us with a cryptic interior that has no &ldquo;room&rdquo; for us, camera obscuras &ndash; as models of analogue image-making technology in general &ndash; admit us, let us in. They make real space for our bodies rather than a virtual space we cannot inhabit. They are part of the physical world we live in. Analog and digital media both make images, of course, but the former also appeals to our tactile sense, and thus answers our desire for physical connection with our world and with those objects and other bodies with whom we share our rooms. (Jonathan Walley)<\/p>\n\n<p>This program is made possible by the New York City Artist Corps.<\/p>\n\n<p>Gibson + Recoder have exhibited their celebrated expanded cinema performances and installations at the Museum Kunstpalast D&uuml;sseldorf, M HKA, Serralves Foundation, EYE Film Museum, REDCAT, Mad. Sq. Art, and Ballroom Marfa. Their works are in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, and Memorial Art Gallery.

Based on Charles M. Blow&rsquo;s moving memoir of the same name and featuring a libretto by Kasi Lemmons, this new staging is co-directed by James Robinson and Camille A. Brown. Brown, who is also the production&rsquo;s choreographer, becomes the first Black director to create a mainstage Met production.

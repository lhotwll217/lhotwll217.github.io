As he sought refuge from these restrictions in the city&rsquo;s greenspaces, he experienced the restorative power of flowers in bloom, which gave him hope despite the surrounding pandemic and political turmoil. In this series, his non-figurative compositions combine floral and leaf forms with wholly abstract linear patterns. To achieve the paintings&rsquo; luminous power, he applies several coats of translucent acrylics over an under-layer of aluminum leaf which reflects and refracts light through the layers of semi-transparent paint.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Know Before You Go<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As a precaution due to COVID-19, several new policies are being implemented to keep visitors safe.

As he sought refuge from these restrictions in the city&rsquo;s greenspaces, he experienced the restorative power of flowers in bloom, which gave him hope despite the surrounding pandemic and political turmoil. In this series, his non-figurative compositions combine floral and leaf forms with wholly abstract linear patterns. To achieve the paintings&rsquo; luminous power, he applies several coats of translucent acrylics over an under-layer of aluminum leaf which reflects and refracts light through the layers of semi-transparent paint.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Know Before You Go<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As a precaution due to COVID-19, several new policies are being implemented to keep visitors safe.

series was inspired by the artist&rsquo;s walks through New York City&rsquo;s public parks and gardens during lockdown. As he sought refuge from these restrictions in the city&rsquo;s greenspaces, he experienced the restorative power of flowers in bloom, which gave him hope despite the surrounding pandemic and political turmoil. In this series, his non-figurative compositions combine floral and leaf forms with wholly abstract linear patterns. To achieve the paintings&rsquo; luminous power, he applies several coats of translucent acrylics over an under-layer of aluminum leaf which reflects and refracts light through the layers of semi-transparent paint.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Know Before You Go<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As a precaution due to COVID-19, several new policies are being implemented to keep visitors safe.

As he sought refuge from these restrictions in the city&rsquo;s greenspaces, he experienced the restorative power of flowers in bloom, which gave him hope despite the surrounding pandemic and political turmoil. In this series, his non-figurative compositions combine floral and leaf forms with wholly abstract linear patterns. To achieve the paintings&rsquo; luminous power, he applies several coats of translucent acrylics over an under-layer of aluminum leaf which reflects and refracts light through the layers of semi-transparent paint.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Know Before You Go<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As a precaution due to COVID-19, several new policies are being implemented to keep visitors safe.

Bring your jack-o-lantern or uncarved pumpkin to HRPK&rsquo;s Pier 84 to squash, smash, and smush them into compost to help keep our Park beautiful, green, and growing. Registration will go live soon &mdash; check back regularly to reserve your time slot.<\/p>\n\n<p>This November, don&rsquo;t miss a chance to participate in an HRPK fall favorite, Pumpkin Smash! A sustainable way to celebrate the season, Pumpkin Smash provides a way for pumpkins to be broken down and repurposed into compost by Hudson River Park&rsquo;s team. You&rsquo;ll get fifteen minutes of smashing fun and your choice of a bat, hammer, or shovel to break up your gourd into the smallest pieces you can! Stick around after to learn from the HRPK team how composting works at the Park and enjoy the beautiful pier.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hudson River Park&rsquo;s annual Pumpkin Smash is designed to help divert seasonal organic waste from landfills as well as educate and engage our Park community. Composting at Pumpkin Smash and year-round benefits both Hudson River Park and our community. Nutrient-rich soil promotes healthier plant beds and insulates plants during the winter by helping them retain water. Collecting horticultural and food scraps also reduces our waste stream and support the park&rsquo;s overall sustainability.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note:<\/strong> Due to Covid-19 safety precautions, this event requires pre-registration, with timed entry. One (FREE) ticket is for one household, of up to five people. Groups are asked to bring their own pumpkins, as well as safety goggles or face shields if you have them at home! Each group will have 15 minutes of smashing good fun!<\/p>\n\n<p>Please note due to limited capacity for this event, if you are more than five minutes late, you may lose your time slot.

Roots\/Anchors exhibiting artist Katie Holten has created a Wildflower Alphabet for New York City, with drawings of 26 native wildflowers, one for each letter of the Latin alphabet. Visitors to the exhibition are invited to take seeds of the four wildflowers that spell LOVE to plant around the city. This could be the beginning of seeding stories, planting secret messages with native wildflowers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Katie Holten invites participants to write Letters to the Earth that could take the form of personal stories, poems, words, or planted messages to the future. Together, we will create a vision of a better world to share with political leaders as they meet at COP26.<\/p>\n\n<p>What people have to say right now matters.

Face coverings for visitors ages 2 and up are required in all indoor spaces and the New York Chinese Scholar&rsquo;s Garden, as well as in outdoor areas when social distancing is not possible, even if vaccinated.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Artist<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Katie Holten (b. 1975, Dublin) is a visual artist and environmental activist based in New York City and Ardee. For over twenty years Katie Holten has made unconventional works, pushing the boundaries of ecological art. At the root of her practice is a commitment to study the inextricable relationship between Humans and Nature, between organic systems and human-made systems. Drawing is her primary research tool. In 2003, Holten represented Ireland at the 50th Venice Biennale with a solo pavilion presentation entitled Laboratorio della Vigna. She has had solo museum exhibitions at the New Orleans Museum of Art in New Orleans (2012), Dublin City Gallery, The Hugh Lane in Dublin (2010), The Bronx Museum of the Arts in New York (2009); Villa Merkel in Esslingen (2008), Nevada Museum of Art in Reno (2008) and the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis (2007). She has conceived major public commissions including TREE MUSEUM (2009-2010) for New York City&rsquo;s Grand Concourse commissioned by the NYC Parks Department, the Bronx Museum and Wave Hill. Several years ago, recognizing a looming crisis of representation as our species adapts to life in the Anthropocene, Holten created a Tree Alphabet and published the book ABOUT TREES, offering readers a language beyond the Human. During lockdown, Holten made a new Irish Tree Alphabet (2020) to explore language ecosystems and the importance of our words and the stories that we share.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Roots\/Anchors is made possible through generous support from the Samuel I.

As he sought refuge from these restrictions in the city&rsquo;s greenspaces, he experienced the restorative power of flowers in bloom, which gave him hope despite the surrounding pandemic and political turmoil. In this series, his non-figurative compositions combine floral and leaf forms with wholly abstract linear patterns. To achieve the paintings&rsquo; luminous power, he applies several coats of translucent acrylics over an under-layer of aluminum leaf which reflects and refracts light through the layers of semi-transparent paint.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Know Before You Go<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As a precaution due to COVID-19, several new policies are being implemented to keep visitors safe.

As he sought refuge from these restrictions in the city&rsquo;s greenspaces, he experienced the restorative power of flowers in bloom, which gave him hope despite the surrounding pandemic and political turmoil. In this series, his non-figurative compositions combine floral and leaf forms with wholly abstract linear patterns.

As he sought refuge from these restrictions in the city&rsquo;s greenspaces, he experienced the restorative power of flowers in bloom, which gave him hope despite the surrounding pandemic and political turmoil. In this series, his non-figurative compositions combine floral and leaf forms with wholly abstract linear patterns. To achieve the paintings&rsquo; luminous power, he applies several coats of translucent acrylics over an under-layer of aluminum leaf which reflects and refracts light through the layers of semi-transparent paint.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Know Before You Go<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As a precaution due to COVID-19, several new policies are being implemented to keep visitors safe.

As he sought refuge from these restrictions in the city&rsquo;s greenspaces, he experienced the restorative power of flowers in bloom, which gave him hope despite the surrounding pandemic and political turmoil. In this series, his non-figurative compositions combine floral and leaf forms with wholly abstract linear patterns. To achieve the paintings&rsquo; luminous power, he applies several coats of translucent acrylics over an under-layer of aluminum leaf which reflects and refracts light through the layers of semi-transparent paint.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Know Before You Go<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As a precaution due to COVID-19, several new policies are being implemented to keep visitors safe.

As he sought refuge from these restrictions in the city&rsquo;s greenspaces, he experienced the restorative power of flowers in bloom, which gave him hope despite the surrounding pandemic and political turmoil. In this series, his non-figurative compositions combine floral and leaf forms with wholly abstract linear patterns. To achieve the paintings&rsquo; luminous power, he applies several coats of translucent acrylics over an under-layer of aluminum leaf which reflects and refracts light through the layers of semi-transparent paint.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Know Before You Go<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As a precaution due to COVID-19, several new policies are being implemented to keep visitors safe.

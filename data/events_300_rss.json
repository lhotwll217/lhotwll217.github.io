In addition to this role, he is also helping develop the Community Business Development Officer Team with the goal of helping to be a trusted advisor for diverse business communities. He has spent over 20 years fostering banking relationships with the LGBTQ+ and diverse business community in New Jersey and New York. At TD, he is the co-chair for the Metro NY Regional Diversity Council and a member of the LGBTQ2+ Diversity Leadership Team working group for the US.  <\/p>\n\n<p>As part of his community outreach, he works to deliver business and community development into LGBTQ markets and diverse neighborhoods and leverages his skills and experience in professional networking through the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce. At NGLCC, he is a member of the Certification Committee that verifies that participating enterprises are LGBTQ-owned and operated. That certification, in turn, helps business owners gain access to supplier diversity initiatives at larger corporations and select City and State government offices looking to purchase the goods and services they offer.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Animating Garibell&rsquo;s career is the belief that everyone should have a chance to be successful, no matter what their background is. Based on that view, he works to drive positive change through working collaborations that enrich the lives of the LGBTQ community and its talented entrepreneurs and small  business owners.

As TD Bank&#39;s community business development officer, Marcus is even more focused on community advocacy and positively impacting diverse business communities.

Sorin-Horsford will discuss the <a href=\"https:\/\/dyckmanfarmhouse.org\/dyckmandiscovered\/\">DyckmanDISCOVERED<\/a> initiative developed by her team, which investigates the stories of enslaved people who lived and worked on Dutch farms in what is now called Inwood. This initiative brings an inclusive history to the community, fosters a sense of transparency, and hopes to engage visitors who have not seen themselves represented in the current narrative.<\/p>\n\n<p>The restoration of Lefferts Historic House is made possible through $2.5 million in funding from the Brooklyn Delegation of the New York City Council, and includes replacing the roof, restoring the exterior of the building, and repairing paths and drainage surrounding the house. The restoration is currently underway, and slated to be completed in 2022.<\/p>\n\n<p>This event is free and open to the public. It will take place outside on the Carousel lawn, across from Lefferts Historic House. RSVPs are suggested, but not required, for admittance.<\/p>\n\n<p>Prospect Park Alliance takes the safety of their patrons and staff very seriously.

Set during the 1970s punk rock revolution in London, the story follows a clever and creative young grifter named Estella, who is determined to become a successful designer. After Estella befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, the three build a life for themselves on the London streets. Before long, Estella&rsquo;s flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute fashion legend, played by Emma Thompson (HOWARDS END, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY). But their relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable and revenge-bent Cruella.

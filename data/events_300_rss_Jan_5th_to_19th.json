How can we hold space for and resolve conflict within our groups? In these monthly sessions, mediators Skye Roper-Moses and Michelle Jackson will facilitate discussion circles for community gardeners to bring their challenges to the group and collectively generate solutions. The facilitators will model skills for holding space that gardeners can bring back to their own groups to begin to develop a practice for addressing and transforming conflict in the garden.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>All sessions meet 6:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/conflict-transformation-circles-for-community-gardeners-tickets-212717472687\">RSVP on Eventbrite<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Session 1 Theme:<\/strong> (Dec. 16) What happens when tensions rise due to differences in communication because of personal values?<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Session 2 Theme: <\/strong>(Jan. 13) How do age & gender affect garden communities when in conflict?<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Session 3 Theme: <\/strong>(Feb. 16) How do we communicate in our garden community when we don&rsquo;t feel included in the space?<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Session 4 Theme:<\/strong> (March 16) Strategies for understanding cultural nuances within the garden community to thwart conflict?<br \/>\n\t<em>*This will be a confidential space that is not recorded.

We incorporate resistance training throughout the class both when seated and standing while listening to your favorite oldies but goodies music. The class flow is designed to keep your body and joints moving in a whole new way. You can even practice some of the chair lunges in your own living room to keep your energy and fitness level up! All participants will be walking on the track two times during the class to give your chair a rest from all your Russian twists, arm curls, leg scissors and chair running!<\/p><p>Start time: 9:30 am<\/p><p>End time: 10:30 am<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Arena (in Ocean Breeze Park)<\/p>","parkids":"R149","parknames":"Ocean Breeze Park","startdate":"2022-01-18","enddate":"2022-01-18","starttime":"9:30 am","endtime":"10:30 am","contact_phone":null,"location":"Arena (in Ocean Breeze Park)","categories":"Adaptive Programs | Fitness | Seniors | Recreation Center Programming | Exercise Classes | Strength Training\/Weightlifting | Walking","coordinates":"40.58259200000000000, -74.07530800000000000","image":"","pubDate":"Wed, 05 Jan 2022 19:00:04 EST"},{"title":"Oil Painting","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/01\/18\/oil-painting3","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2022\/01\/18\/oil-painting3","description":"<p>Date: January 18, 2022<\/p><p>This class has produced beautiful art pieces in this center over the years.

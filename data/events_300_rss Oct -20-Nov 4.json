Set during the 1970s punk rock revolution in London, the story follows a clever and creative young grifter named Estella, who is determined to become a successful designer. After Estella befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, the three build a life for themselves on the London streets. Before long, Estella&rsquo;s flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute fashion legend, played by Emma Thompson (HOWARDS END, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY). But their relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable, and revenge-bent Cruella.

Using ideas about our lives in dreams contributed by the public during open workshops in Old Stone House Washington Park in July 2021, this third Theater to the People ensemble has devised a kaleidoscopic collage performance over the course of only eleven sessions.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatertothepeople.com\">Theater to the People<\/a> is a collaboration between the physical theater artist Julia Cavagna and the playwright\/director Kate Bell. It focuses on bringing bilingual (Spanish\/English) and socially engaged theater-making experiences to adults with little to no previous drama experience. TTTP brings together many perspectives from people living in New York City: new immigrants, people who identify as first-generation Americans, people who have lived here for generations, and people who might identify as &ldquo;gentrifiers.&rdquo; TTTP seeks to inspire community organizing and resilience by building creative, social, and political alliances among people from a wide variety of backgrounds through the act of collaboratively making theater.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Accessibility:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>JJ Byrne Playground and the Old Stone House are located within Washington Park in Park Slope Brooklyn at 5th Avenue between 3rd and 4th Streets.<\/p>\n\n<p>The performance will occur in front of the Old Stone House on the lawn.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two public restrooms at Old Stone House open to people of all genders.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>COVID-19 Protocol:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Performers will not be masked for the duration of the performance.

It is intelligent like a riddle and catchy like an over-saturated cartoon. On Easy Bammer, May turns months of isolation into a curious & hyperreal reflection on memory of a time in New York City before stay-at-home-orders and lukewarm take-out&mdash;reflections on a time when staying at home & thinking felt like an unreasonable request of the cosmos. May Rio&rsquo;s Easy Bammer gives its listener a chance to experience the warmth & quiet laughter of reflection; it does so in a time otherwise reserved for most as an endless cycle of waiting for new headlines.<\/p>\n\n<p>HOSTED BY CHARLIE BARDEY!<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ktzUFe7wCfA&t=4s<\/p>\n\n<p>This event is supported by a New York City Artist Corps Grant.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 3:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 7:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Old Stone House (in J.J.
